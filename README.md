You'll need to have [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) installed
in order to pull the DuniaDota dependency.

So first run `carthage bootstrap` to build DuniaDota framework then open the
`DuniaDota.xcodeproj` file.

+ Use Keychain-Swift for saving text and data in the Keychain
+ Use FSPagerView for screen slide library
